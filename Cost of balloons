// You are conducting a contest at your college. This contest consists of two problems and  participants. You know the problem that a candidate will solve during the contest.

// You provide a balloon to a participant after he or she solves a problem. There are only green and purple-colored balloons available in a market. Each problem must have a balloon associated with it as a prize for solving that specific problem. You can distribute balloons to each participant by performing the following operation:

// Use green-colored balloons for the first problem and purple-colored balloons for the second problem
// Use purple-colored balloons for the first problem and green-colored balloons for the second problem
// You are given the cost of each balloon and problems that each participant solve. Your task is to print the minimum price that you have to pay while purchasing balloons.

// Input format

// First line:  that denotes the number of test cases ()
// For each test case: 
// First line: Cost of green and purple-colored balloons 
// Second line:  that denotes the number of participants ()
// Next  lines: Contain the status of users. For example, if the value of the  integer in the  row is , then it depicts that the  participant has not solved the  problem. Similarly, if the value of the  integer in the  row is , then it depicts that the  participant has solved the  problem.
// Output format
// For each test case, print the minimum cost that you have to pay to purchase balloons.
